# Ancient Language Handwritten Recognition Under Data Deficient Condition

This repository contains the implementation of a project focused on improving handwritten character recognition for ancient Indian languages using Capsule Networks, particularly under conditions of limited data.

## Introduction
The project addresses the challenge of recognizing handwritten characters in ancient Indian languages, which often suffer from a lack of substantial labeled training data. By leveraging Capsule Networks and innovative data augmentation techniques, the project aims to enhance recognition accuracy with very small datasets.



## Methodology
The system comprises several key steps:

1. Initial training of the CapsNet model

3. Generating instantiation parameters and reconstructed images

3. Applying decoder re-training techniques

4. New image data generation

5. Training the CapsNet model afresh with the new dataset

## Usage
1. Install [requirements.txt](https://github.com/unforgettablexD/Ancient-Language-Handwritten-Recognition-Under-Data-Deficient-Condition/blob/main/requirements.txt) and required dependencies like cuDNN. ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
2. Clone this repo: ``` git clone https://github.com/unforgettablexD/Ancient-Language-Handwritten-Recognition-Under-Data-Deficient-Condition.git```
3. Download and extract the [Tamil dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudalairajkumar/tamil-nlp)
[Sanskrit dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashokpant/devanagari-character-dataset/data)
[EMNIST dataset](https://www.nist.gov/itl/products-and-services/emnist-dataset)

5. The following command trains the fresh CapsNet M<sub>1</sub> as illustrated in step (a):
```
python textcaps_emnist_bal.py --cnt 200
``` 
The ```cnt``` parameter specifies the number of training samples to be used. Any other custom dataset can also be used.

5. The following command generates new images as illustrated in step (b)-(d):
```
python textcaps_emnist_bal.py -dg --save_dir emnist_bal_200/ -w emnist_bal_200/trained_model.h5 --samples_to_generate 10
``` 
Any arbitrary number of new data samples can be generated by specifying the ```samples_to_generate``` parameter.


## Results

We trained our model on 190 training samples per class across different datasets and compared our results with the state-of-the-art accuracies as shown in Table 2. Despite the limited number of training samples, our model achieved comparable accuracy to these state-of-the-art models.

In particular, for the Sanskrit dataset, our model closely matched the state-of-the-art with an accuracy of 95.27%. For EMNIST-Digits, we showed the robustness of our model by nearly matching the state-of-the-art accuracy. In the Tamil dataset, our model achieved a remarkable 95.86% accuracy.

### Handwritten Character Recognition

Here's how our model's performance compares to the current state-of-the-art:

| Dataset       | State-of-the-Art Model Accuracy (Full training set) | Our Model (190 Samples/Class) |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Sanskrit      | 98.47% (Acharya et al., 2015)                       | 95.27%                       |
| EMNIST-Digits | 99.79% (Dufoorq & Bassett, 2017)                    | 99.64%                       |
| Tamil         | 98.04% (Ulaganathan et al., 2020)                   | 95.86%                       |

Our approach demonstrates that it is feasible to train accurate models for ancient language character recognition with very small datasets.
